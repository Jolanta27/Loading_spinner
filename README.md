<h3>How to open a file? ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€</h3>
<p>- On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.</p>
<p>- An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.</p>
<p>- Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.</p>
<p>- And then "go live" is enough!</p>
